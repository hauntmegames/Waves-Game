# Waves — Game Off 2025 (Source Code)

A 3D adventure built in Unity for the "Wave" theme.

## What IS included (full playable source)
- `Assets/Scripts/` – all gameplay code  
- `Assets/Scenes/` – all 5+ scenes with lighting, triggers, and logic  
- `ProjectSettings/` – input, physics, build settings, etc.  
- `Packages/` – manifest with all dependencies (Unity auto-downloads them)

You can clone this repo and hit Play in Unity right now – the game logic, player controller, wave mechanics, UI, etc. are all here and fully functional.

## What is NOT included (due to GitHub size limits)
- Large 3D models (Meshy-generated)  
- Audio clips  
- Video files  
- High-res textures  

These total ~2.7 GB and exceed GitHub’s per-file web-upload limits.  
They are purely art assets and contain no code.  
The playable build on itch.io contains everything.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open in Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer  
3. Press Play – all gameplay works as-is (I think, this is my 1st time using Github)
