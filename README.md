# Waves — Source Code (Game Off 2025)

This repository contains the minimal Unity source required to open and inspect the game:
- ProjectSettings/
- Packages/
- Assets/Scripts/ (core gameplay scripts)

**Art assets (3D models, textures, audio, video) are intentionally excluded.**  
These assets are not required for code inspection and were left out per jam guidelines.
